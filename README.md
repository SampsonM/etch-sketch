## Etch-sketch
#

This was created as a little test of HTML Canvas to see how the basics worked, it is by no means perfect but it is compatible with mobile use i.e touchscreen.

I also used this as an opportunity to learn Adobe Illustrator and create all the graphics used as a border.

#

### How

To use add the etcha-sketch simply add the build button and the etch sketch div to your project and the relevant JS.

In future I plan to animate the circle dials when operated by the arrow keys, and touchable buttons for mobile use.
